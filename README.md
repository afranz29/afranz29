## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a rising senior student at UMBC, studying computer science with a focus on cybersecurity and data science. Here you'll find all the projects I've worked on, personal and in school!

**Summer 2025** <br />
I'm currently an intern at Alyssum Global Services working remotely on an upcoming project! 
On the side I'm gradually developing a Minecraft Mod for 1.20.1 (simply because I couldn't find one that I wanted).
